## Timestamp Privacy Policy

### Timestamp App
Timestamp may access your photos and camera only after permission is granted. This access can be removed at any time in the Settings app. Timestamp does not collect or store photos or any information about the photos in your photo library. Photos are not transmitted outside of the app. Processing of the photos is performed on the device.

### Changes to This Policy
You are advised to review this policy periodically for any changes. By using the Timestamp app, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Marcoc88/Timestamp/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
